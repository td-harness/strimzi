== Contributing to the documentation

Once you have your local repository set up and have up to date copies of upstream content you need to follow these steps to contribute to the documentation.

.Procedure
. Open your terminal
. `cd` to the directory where your documentation resides
. Checkout the main branch
+
[source]
----
$ git checkout main
----
. Update your local repository and fork with the upstream content
+
[source]
----
$ git pull upstream main
$ git push origin main --force
----
. Create a new branch for your work (using the issue number is helpful)
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>
----
. Make your edits in the editor of your choice
. Save your changes locally
. Build your documentation to verify that there are no build errors and that everything looks right
.. This can be done with the xref:make-tooling[Make tooling]
. If you are creating new files, add the files to the repository
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git status
$ git add <file-name>
----

. Commit your changes
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git commit -a -s -m "<message>"
----
+
Note that the project requires all commits to be signed off, indicating that _you_ certify the changes with the link:https://developercertificate.org/[developer certificate of origin (DCO)]. 
. Push your changes to your fork
+
[source]
----
$ git push origin HEAD
----
. If the update is rejected because the commit is behind, merge your changes
+
[source]
----
$ git pull upstream main
$ git push -f origin HEAD
----

. Add *Peer Review Needed* label and assign a Reviewer.
.. When peer review has been completed, the reviewer deletes the *Peer Review Needed* label and adds the *Peer Review Done* label.
. When *Peer Review Done* label has been added:
.. If no changes are needed, remove *Peer Review Done* label and add *Ready for Merge* label.
.. If changes are needed and the changes are minor, make changes to the files, commit, and push, and then remove *Peer Review Done* label and add *Ready for Merge* label.
.. If you want an additional review on the updated content, add the *Peer Review Needed* label and ask for another review in a comment.
