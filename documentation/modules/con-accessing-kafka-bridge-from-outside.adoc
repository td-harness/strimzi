= Accessing the Kafka Bridge outside of Kubernetes

After deployment, the Strimzi Kafka Bridge can only be accessed by applications running in the same Kubernetes cluster. These applications use the `_kafka-bridge-name_-bridge-service` Service to access the API.

If you want to make the Kafka Bridge accessible to applications running outside of the Kubernetes cluster, you can expose it manually by using one of the following features:

* Services of types LoadBalancer or NodePort

* Ingress resources

* OpenShift Routes

If you decide to create Services, use the following labels in the `selector` to configure the pods to which the service will route the traffic:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
  # ...
  selector:
    strimzi.io/cluster: kafka-bridge-name <1>
    strimzi.io/kind: KafkaBridge
  #...
----
<1> Name of the Kafka Bridge custom resource in your Kubernetes cluster.
