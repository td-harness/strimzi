= Scaling up a Kafka cluster

This procedure describes how to increase the number of brokers in a Kafka cluster.

.Prerequisites

* An existing Kafka cluster.
* A _reassignment JSON file_ named `_reassignment.json_` that describes how partitions should be reassigned to brokers in the enlarged cluster.

.Procedure

. Add as many new brokers as you need by increasing the `Kafka.spec.kafka.replicas` configuration option.

. Verify that the new broker pods have started.
