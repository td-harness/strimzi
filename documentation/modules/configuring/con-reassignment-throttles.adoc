= Reassignment throttles

Partition reassignment can be a slow process because it involves transferring large amounts of data between brokers.
To avoid a detrimental impact on clients, you can throttle the reassignment process.
This might cause the reassignment to take longer to complete.

* If the throttle is too low then the newly assigned brokers will not be able to keep up with records being published and the reassignment will never complete.

* If the throttle is too high then clients will be impacted.

For example, for producers, this could manifest as higher than normal latency waiting for acknowledgement. For consumers, this could manifest as a drop in throughput caused by higher latency between polls.
