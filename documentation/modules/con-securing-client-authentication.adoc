= User authentication

User authentication is configured using the `authentication` property in `KafkaUser.spec`.
The authentication mechanism enabled for the user is specified using the `type` field.

Supported authentication mechanisms:

* TLS client authentication
* SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication

When no authentication mechanism is specified, the User Operator does not create the user or its credentials.

== TLS Client Authentication

To use TLS client authentication, you set the `type` field to `tls`.

.An example `KafkaUser` with TLS client authentication enabled
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaUserApiVersion}
kind: KafkaUser
metadata:
  name: my-user
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  authentication:
    type: tls
  # ...
----

When the user is created by the User Operator, it creates a new Secret with the same name as the `KafkaUser` resource.
The Secret contains a private and public key for TLS client authentication.
The public key is contained in a user certificate, which is signed by the client Certificate Authority (CA).

All keys are in X.509 format.

Secrets provide private keys and certificates in PEM and PKCS #12 formats.

For more information on securing Kafka communication with Secrets, see xref:security-{context}[].

  user.key: # Private key of the user
  user.p12: # PKCS #12 archive file for storing certificates and keys
  user.password: # Password for protecting the PKCS #12 archive file

== SCRAM-SHA-512 Authentication

To use the SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication mechanism, you set the `type` field to `scram-sha-512`.

.An example `KafkaUser` with SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication enabled

  # ...
----

When the user is created by the User Operator, it creates a new secret with the same name as the `KafkaUser` resource.
The secret contains the generated password in the `password` key, which is encoded with base64.
In order to use the password, it must be decoded.
