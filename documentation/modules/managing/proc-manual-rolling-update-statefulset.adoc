= Performing a rolling update using a StatefulSet annotation

This procedure describes how to manually trigger a rolling update of an existing Kafka cluster or ZooKeeper cluster using a Kubernetes `StatefulSet` annotation.

.Procedure

. Find the name of the `StatefulSet` that controls the Kafka or ZooKeeper pods you want to manually update.
+
For example, if your Kafka cluster is named _my-cluster_, the corresponding `StatefulSet` names are _my-cluster-kafka_ and _my-cluster-zookeeper_.

. Annotate the `StatefulSet` resource in Kubernetes.
+
Use `kubectl annotate`:
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
kubectl annotate statefulset _cluster-name_-kafka strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update=true

kubectl annotate statefulset _cluster-name_-zookeeper strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update=true
----

. Wait for the next reconciliation to occur (every two minutes by default).
A rolling update of all pods within the annotated `StatefulSet` is triggered, as long as the annotation was detected by the reconciliation process.
When the rolling update of all the pods is complete, the annotation is removed from the `StatefulSet`.
