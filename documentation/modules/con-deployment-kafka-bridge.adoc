= Kafka Bridge deployment

You deploy the Kafka Bridge into your Kubernetes cluster by using the Cluster Operator.

After the Kafka Bridge is deployed, the Cluster Operator creates Kafka Bridge objects in your Kubernetes cluster.
Objects include the _deployment_, _service_, and _pod_, each named after the name given in the custom resource for the Kafka Bridge.
