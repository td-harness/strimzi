= Deploying Kafka Connect to your Kubernetes cluster

This procedure shows how to deploy a Kafka Connect cluster to your Kubernetes cluster using the Cluster Operator.

A Kafka Connect cluster is implemented as a `Deployment` with a configurable number of nodes (also called _workers_) that distribute the workload of connectors as _tasks_ so that the message flow is highly scalable and reliable.

The deployment uses a YAML file to provide the specification to create a `KafkaConnect` resource.

In this procedure, we use the example file provided with Strimzi:

* `examples/connect/kafka-connect.yaml`

For information about configuring the `KafkaConnect` resource (or the `KafkaConnectS2I` resource with Source-to-Image (S2I) support),
see link:{BookURLUsing}#assembly-kafka-connect-str[Kafka Connect cluster configuration^] in the _Using Strimzi_ guide.

* xref:deploying-kafka-cluster-str[Running Kafka cluster.]

.Procedure

. Deploy Kafka Connect to your Kubernetes cluster.
Use the `examples/connect/kafka-connect.yaml` file to deploy Kafka Connect.
