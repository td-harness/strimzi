= Create the Kafka cluster

In order to create your Kafka cluster, you deploy the Cluster Operator to manage the Kafka cluster, then deploy the Kafka cluster.

When deploying the Kafka cluster using the `Kafka` resource, you can deploy the Topic Operator and User Operator at the same time.
Alternatively, if you are using a non-Strimzi Kafka cluster, you can deploy the Topic Operator and User Operator as standalone components.

== Deploying a standalone Topic Operator and User Operator

Perform these deployment steps if you want to use the Topic Operator and User Operator with a Kafka cluster that is *not managed* by Strimzi.
