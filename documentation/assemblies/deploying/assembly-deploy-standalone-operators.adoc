= Alternative standalone deployment options for Strimzi Operators

When deploying a Kafka cluster using the Cluster Operator, you can also deploy the Topic Operator and User Operator.
Alternatively, you can perform a standalone deployment.

A standalone deployment means the Topic Operator and User Operator can operate with a Kafka cluster that is not managed by Strimzi.
