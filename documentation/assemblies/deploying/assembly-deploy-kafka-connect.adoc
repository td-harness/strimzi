= Deploy Kafka Connect

link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect[Kafka Connect^] is a tool for streaming data between Apache Kafka and external systems.

In Strimzi, Kafka Connect is deployed in distributed mode.
Kafka Connect can also work in standalone mode, but this is not supported by Strimzi.

Using the concept of _connectors_, Kafka Connect provides a framework for moving large amounts of data into and out of your Kafka cluster while maintaining scalability and reliability.

Kafka Connect is typically used to integrate Kafka with external databases and storage and messaging systems.

The procedures in this section show how to:

* xref:using-kafka-connect-with-plug-ins-{context}[Create a Kafka Connect image containing the connectors you need to make your connection]
* xref:con-creating-managing-connectors-{context}[Create and manage connectors using a KafkaConnector resource or the Kafka Connect REST API]

NOTE: The term _connector_ is used interchangeably to mean a connector instance running within a Kafka Connect cluster, or a connector class.
In this guide, the term _connector_ is used when the meaning is clear from the context.
