= Upgrading the Cluster Operator

The steps to upgrade your Cluster Operator deployment to use Strimzi {ProductVersion} are described in this section.

Follow this procedure if you deployed the Cluster Operator using the installation YAML files rather than {OperatorHub}.

The availability of Kafka clusters managed by the Cluster Operator is not affected by the upgrade operation.

NOTE: Refer to the documentation supporting a specific version of Strimzi for information on how to upgrade to that version.
