= Kafka Connect/S2I cluster configuration

This section describes how to configure a Kafka Connect or Kafka Connect with Source-to-Image (S2I) deployment in your Strimzi cluster.

Kafka Connect is an integration toolkit for streaming data between Kafka brokers and other systems using connector plugins.
Kafka Connect provides a framework for integrating Kafka with an external data source or target, such as a database, for import or export of data using connectors.
Connectors are plugins that provide the connection configuration needed.

If you are using Kafka Connect, you configure either the `KafkaConnect` or the `KafkaConnectS2I` resource.
Use the `KafkaConnectS2I` resource if you are using the {docs-okd-s2i} framework to deploy Kafka Connect.

* The full schema of the `KafkaConnect` resource is described in xref:type-KafkaConnect-reference[].
* The full schema of the `KafkaConnectS2I` resource is described in xref:type-KafkaConnectS2I-reference[].

IMPORTANT: With the introduction of `build` configuration to the `KafkaConnect` resource, Strimzi can now automatically build a container image with the connector plugins you require for your data connections.
As a result, support for Kafka Connect with Source-to-Image (S2I) is deprecated. To prepare for this change, you can xref:proc-migrating-kafka-connect-s2i-{context}[migrate Kafka Connect S2I instances to Kafka Connect instances].
