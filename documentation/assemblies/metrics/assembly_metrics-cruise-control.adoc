= Monitor Cruise Control

If you are already using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring of built-in Kafka metrics, you can configure Prometheus to also scrape the Cruise Control Prometheus endpoint.

The example Grafana dashboard for Cruise Control provides:

* Information about optimization proposals computation, goals violation, cluster balancedness, and more
* Information about REST API calls for rebalance proposals and actual rebalance operations
* JVM metrics from Cruise Control itself

== Configuring Cruise Control

Enable Cruise Control metrics using the `cruiseControl.metricsConfig` property in the `Kafka` resource to provide a reference to a ConfigMap that contains JMX exporter configuration for the metrics to expose.

For example:
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  # ...
  kafka:
    # ...
  zookeeper:
    # ...
  cruiseControl:
    metricsConfig:
       type: jmxPrometheusExporter
       valueFrom:
         configMapKeyRef:
           name: my-config-map
           key: my-key
----

== Enabling the Cruise Control Grafana dashboard

If you deployed Cruise Control with your Kafka cluster with the metrics enabled, you can enable Grafana to present the metrics data it exposes.

A Cruise Control dashboard is provided in the `examples/metrics` directory as a JSON file:

* `strimzi-cruise-control.json`

When metrics data has been collected for some time, the Cruise Control charts are populated.

Cruise Control:: Shows metrics for:
+
* Number of snapshot windows that are monitored by Cruise Control
* Number of time windows considered valid because they contain enough samples to compute an optimization proposal
* Number of ongoing executions running for proposals or rebalances
* Current balancedness score of the Kafka cluster as calculated by the anomaly detector component of Cruise Control (every 5 minutes by default)
* Percentage of monitored partitions
* Number of goal violations reported by the anomaly detector (every 5 minutes by default)
* How often a disk read failure happens on the brokers
* Rate of metric sample fetch failures
* Time needed to compute an optimization proposal
* Time needed to create the cluster model
* How often a proposal request or an actual rebalance request is made through the Cruise Control REST API
* How often the overall cluster state and the user tasks state are requested through the Cruise Control REST API
* JVM memory used
* JVM garbage collection time
* JVM garbage collection count
